### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My GitHub has two primary uses:
- My private repositories are codes I cannot tell you about as they are most likely:
  - part of confidential projects that I have undertaken either as a freelancer or my reseacrch projects which are still in progress
  - are coursework codes that I do not want to get flagged for self-plagiarism
- My public repositories are showcases for potential employers/professors who would like have me on their research team
